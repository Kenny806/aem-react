The goal of the AEM React library is to use ReactJs as a templating engine for AEM components.

# Why React and AEM?

React components are ideal to create web applications with complex client-side interactivity. AEM provides a perfect authoring interface for web content.
This project brings these technologies together, so that you can build highly interactive web pages with a professional authoring tool.

# Features

- [Universal](http://www.2ality.com/2015/08/isomorphic-javascript.html) React rendering
- High performance javascript execution with a pool of Java 8 [nashorn](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/scripting/nashorn/) engines.
- Nesting React components in other AEM components and vice versa is supported.
- Converting vanilla react components into AEM components is supported
- SPA based on react router is supported.

# Artifacts
